# Advent Of Code 2020

This is the repository containing my solutions for [Advent of Code 2020].

I'm using this as an opportunity to learn F# and put in practice what I've been
playing with recently.

If you want to participate in Advent of Code, I recommend that you don't see the
solutions before you try to solve it yourself, that is the only way to learn and
improve.
